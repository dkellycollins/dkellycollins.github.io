				<p>During the summer of 2013 I worked with Dan Andresen to develop a small web app for internal use
				at K-State using ASP MVC4. One of the requirements of this app was to upload large files that could be gigabytes
				in size. I integrated <a href="https://github.com/blueimp">Sebastian Tschan's</a> 
				<a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">jQuery-File-Upload</a>. The project worked wonderfully however
				I had some issues implementing it as there was not much documentation pertaining to ASP MVC4. Near the end of the summer 
				I decided to take what I had been able to do and post it publically on github. The more advance features still need to 
				be implemented and once they I plan to submit this to Sebastian for use in his documentation.</p>

				<p>In my spare time I enjoy developing games. This game as you might have guessed is the card game
				war with some twists to give it a pokemon theme. When I first started this project I intended to 
				implement the game using C# and forms. I was able to get a command line version of the game running
				before development stalled. Recently Ihave started the project again, but this time intend to implement
				the game using the latest in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

				<p>The game development courses offered at K-State gave me great experience developing and 
				working with frameworks like XNA and PhysX. I wanted to experience some of the other frameworks
				available as well gain more experience developing game so I took an independent study course
				focused on these themes. The product of this course was Castle Crossing. I and two other students
				worked on the game for two semesters and presented our work at K-States open house, where the game
				won third place in the departmental open class display.</p>
