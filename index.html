				<p>During the summer of 2013 I worked with Dan Andresen to develop a small web app for internal use
				at K-State using ASP MVC4. One of the requirements of this app was to upload large files that could be gigabytes
				in size. I integrated <a href="https://github.com/blueimp">Sebastian Tschan's</a> 
				<a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload">jQuery-File-Upload</a>. The project worked wonderfully however
				I had some issues implementing it as there was not much documentation pertaining to ASP MVC4. Near the end of the summer 
				I decided to take what I had been able to do and post it publically on github. The more advance features still need to 
				be implemented and once they I plan to submit this to Sebastian for use in his documentation.</p>

				<p>In the first game design course I took at K-State we were able to make two game using the XNA framework.
				One of these games was a Sci-fi dungeon crawling game we creativly called Dungeon Crawler. The game was 
				built using a component based design instead of an object oriented design. Personally, I was responsible for the
				attack animation and logic, user input, and I assited with the GUI for the game.</p>

				<p>The game development courses offered at K-State gave me great experience developing and 
				working with frameworks like XNA and PhysX. I wanted to experience some of the other frameworks
				available as well gain more experience developing game so I took an independent study course
				focused on these themes. The product of this course was Castle Crossing. I and two other students
				worked on the game for two semesters and presented our work at K-States open house, where the game
				won third place in the departmental open class display. I am still working on this game and intend
				to have it completed by August of this year.</p>
